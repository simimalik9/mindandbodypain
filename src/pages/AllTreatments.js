    { name: "Synvisc/Hylagan Injections", description: "Also known as viscosupplementation, this therapy involves injecting a gel-like substance called hyaluronic acid into the knee joint. It acts as a lubricant and shock absorber, improving mobility and reducing pain caused by osteoarthritis." },
    { name: "Transforaminal Selective Nerve Block", description: "A highly specific injection that delivers medication to the point where a nerve root exits the spinal canal. It is used to identify the exact source of nerve pain (sciatica, radiculopathy) and provide targeted relief by reducing inflammation around that specific nerve." },
    { name: "Trigger Point Injections", description: "This procedure involves injecting a local anesthetic and sometimes a corticosteroid into painful, knotted muscles (trigger points). It helps to relax the muscle, relieve pain, and break the cycle of spasms, commonly used for myofascial pain syndrome." },
  ],
  "Nerve Blocks": [
    { name: "Cranial and Facial Nerve Blocks", description: "These specialized injections target nerves in the head and face to diagnose and treat severe pain conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia and atypical facial pain. By blocking pain signals, they can provide significant relief and help pinpoint the source of discomfort." },
    { name: "Peripheral Nerve Blocks", description: "This technique involves injecting an anesthetic near a specific peripheral nerve or a bundle of nerves to block pain signals. It is effective for treating pain in the extremities caused by injury, surgery, or chronic conditions like neuropathy." },
    { name: "Sympathetic Blocks", description: "This type of block targets the sympathetic nervous system, which can sometimes transmit pain signals after an injury. It is a key treatment for conditions like Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and can help reduce swelling, discoloration, and burning pain." },
    { name: "Sympathetic Ganglion Blocks", description: "These injections target specific clusters of sympathetic nerves called ganglia, such as the stellate ganglion in the neck or the lumbar sympathetic chain in the lower back. They are used to treat pain in the head, neck, arms, and legs that is maintained by the sympathetic nervous system." },
    { name: "Stellate Ganglion Block (PTSD)", description: "This injection targets the stellate ganglion in the neck to block sympathetic nerve signals. It is particularly effective for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms by modulating the autonomic nervous system response and reducing anxiety and hyperarousal." },
    { name: "Pudendal Nerve Block", description: "This injection targets the pudendal nerve, which supplies sensation to the genital and anal regions. It is used to treat chronic pelvic pain, vulvodynia, and pain associated with pudendal neuralgia, providing both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits." },
    { name: "Hypogastric Block", description: "This injection targets the hypogastric plexus, a network of nerves in the pelvic region. It is effective for treating chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis-related pain, and other visceral pain conditions in the lower abdomen and pelvis." },
    { name: "Ilioinguinal Block", description: "This injection targets the ilioinguinal nerve, which provides sensation to the groin and inner thigh area. It is used to treat chronic groin pain, post-surgical pain following hernia repair or other abdominal surgeries, and ilioinguinal neuralgia." },
    { name: "Caudal Ganglion Impar Block", description: "This injection targets the ganglion impar, a sympathetic ganglion located at the base of the spine. It is used to treat chronic coccydynia (tailbone pain), perineal pain, and other conditions affecting the lower pelvic region." },
  ],
  "Ablation / Denervation": [
    { name: "Cryoablation of Peripheral Nerves", description: "This procedure uses a probe to deliver extremely cold temperatures to targeted peripheral nerves. The intense cold freezes and destroys the nerve, interrupting pain signals for an extended period and providing long-term relief from chronic pain." },
    { name: "Medial Branch Denervation", description: "Following successful medial branch blocks, this procedure (also known as radiofrequency ablation) uses heat to create a lesion on the nerve, preventing it from sending pain signals from the facet joints. This can provide pain relief that lasts for several months to over a year." },
    { name: "Radiofrequency Ablation", description: "A minimally invasive procedure that uses an electrical current produced by a radio wave to heat up a small area of nerve tissue. This process destroys the nerve's ability to transmit pain signals, offering long-lasting relief for various chronic pain conditions." },
    { name: "Radiofrequency of Peripheral Nerves", description: "This technique applies the principles of radiofrequency ablation to specific peripheral nerves that have been identified as sources of chronic pain. It is used to treat conditions such as peripheral neuropathy and nerve entrapment syndromes." },
  ],
  "Regenerative / Biologic Therapies": [
    { name: "Prolotherapy", description: "Also known as proliferation therapy, this treatment involves injecting a mild irritant solution (often a dextrose solution) into damaged ligaments or tendons. This triggers a localized inflammatory response that stimulates the bodyâ€™s natural healing and tissue repair mechanisms." },
    { name: "Stem Cell Treatment", description: "A cutting-edge regenerative therapy where stem cells are harvested (often from the patient's own body) and injected into injured areas. These cells have the ability to develop into various types of tissue, promoting the healing and regeneration of damaged cartilage, tendons, or ligaments." },
    { name: "Bone Marrow Aspirate", description: "This procedure involves harvesting bone marrow from the iliac crest, which contains stem cells and growth factors. The aspirate can be used for regenerative purposes or as part of other therapeutic interventions to promote healing and tissue repair." },
  ],
  "Implantable / Device-Based Therapies": [
    { name: "Spinal Cord Stimulator Implant", description: "A small, implantable device, similar to a pacemaker, that delivers low-level electrical signals to the spinal cord. These signals interfere with and mask pain signals before they can reach the brain, providing significant relief for patients with chronic back, leg, or arm pain." },
  ],
  "Minimally Invasive Spine Procedures": [
    { name: "Discography", description: "Also known as a discogram, this diagnostic test involves injecting contrast dye into one or more spinal discs under X-ray guidance. It is used to identify the exact disc that is causing a patient's back pain by pressurizing the disc to see if it reproduces their typical symptoms." },
